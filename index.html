                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Luyinga Lumbale Leonard and I am from the Democratic Republic of Congo but I am actually 
                        living in Cape Town. I am married and have two children. my favorite 
                       food is chicken gatsby. I like to ride a bike, I like going out.
                       I am doing web design because I want to create responsive websites. 
                       I like the gospel of Jesus-Christ because 
                       it shows me the way to go to our heavenly father because in john 3:16 Jesus said For God so loved 
                       the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, 
                       but have everlasting life.   
                    </p>

                    <p>South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African
                       continent, marked by several distinct ecosystems. Inland safari 
                       destination Kruger National Park is populated by big game. 
                       The Western Cape offers beaches, lush winelands around Stellenbosch
                       and Paarl, craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and 
                       lagoons along the Garden Route, and the city of Cape Town, beneath
                       flat-topped Table Mountain.
